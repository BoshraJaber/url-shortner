# URL Shortener:

## Project Overview:
- **URL shortening** is a technique on the Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. 
- This is achieved by using a redirect that links to the web page that has a long URL. 
- For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "http://example.com/about/index.html" can be shortened to "https://goo.gl/aO3Ssc ".
